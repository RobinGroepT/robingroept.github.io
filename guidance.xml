This specification contains: 
	<ul>
    <li><a>Logical Models (in a future iteration)</a>, which describe describing several data sets and elements used in Belgian systems</li>
    <li><a>Value Sets and code systems</a>, containing specific Belgian value sets</li>
    <li><a>Core profiles</a>, which constitute the basis for Belgium FHIR profiling and can be reused in other profiles </li>
    <li>Functional Profiles, split by functional area for ease of access</li>
	</ul>

    The implementation guide is structured to allow implementers to pick and choose the capabilities they need and combine them as necessary.

	<h3>Navigation</h3>
	<p>
    This implementation guide follows the FHIR pattern of being published as a web-based specification.  This
    allows easy navigation between the Belgium-specific portion of the implementation guide and the resources,
    data types, value sets and other specification components leveraged from the FHIR core specification.  This
    approach also allows implementers to easily navigate to the information needed to perform a task.
  </p>
	<p>
    A <a href="toc.html">Table of Contents</a> page is provided that lists all of the pages defined as part of this implementation guide.  (Do be aware 
    that some pages have multiple tabs.)  A table of contents is also available for the full <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}toc.html">FHIR specification</a> 
    if you really want to read absolutely everything.  There's also an <a href="artifacts.html">Artifact index</a> that lists all formal FHIR artifacts 
    defined within this implementation guide.  The <i>Support</i> menu provides links to the HL7 standards used by this implementation guide as well as
    providing a <a href="downloads.html">downloads</a> link to retrieve a local copy of this implementation guide and/or particular subsets of it.
  </p>
	<p>
    Bread-crumb navigation is provided in the gray bar just below the menu at the top of each page, allowing
    easy navigation back to the main page.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  
  <h3>Generalities</h3>
  <p>There will be no Belgian publications replacing or describing the overall
base specifications of the HL7 FHIR standard – we consider the pages by HL7 to
be sufficient.</p>

<p>Unless stated otherwise, we consider the mapping between KMEHR
elements and the corresponding elements in FHIR resources to be overall self-evident.
Any mapping initiative SHOULD consider the fact the approach of information in
a KMEHR element as part of an XML document is fundamentally different from a
modular FHIR resource. </p>

<p>Some particularities in this context are described when deemed
necessary. Note the direction in this is how to functionally express that what
is in KMEHR in FHIR, not the other way around.</p>

<p>Implementers are encouraged to study the descriptions of the various
FHIR resources published by HL7, the published Belgian “be-“ profiles here and to
signal <a href="mailto:message-structure@ehealth.fgov.be">message-structure@ehealth.fgov.be</a>
concerning any ambiguities or initiatives that go outside of that realm. </p>

<p>Implementers SHALL take note every instance of a resource SHALL always
explicitely mark when a Belgian or other profile has been used. Implementers SHALL
be aware resources using different technical profiles might follow different
rules.</p>

<p>When needed and mature, eHealth Platform publishes specific profiles
and implementation guidelines for federal initiatives. It also publishes
technical formats of these profiles. These publications will take the form of
downloadable technical profiles according to the FHIR specs. The eHealth
Platform Standards website will publish the necessary links.</p>

<p>The Belgian profiling effort consists of an iterative approach. A
first iteration (2019) contains a basic set of profiles and guidelines on the resources
Patient, Practitioner, PractitionerRole, Organization, Observation, Provenance
and AllergyIntolerance.</p>

<p>Other profiles will be created and/or validated and added to the Belgian
set on on ongoing use case driven basis. </p>

	<h3>Intellectual Property Considerations</h3>
	<p>
    While this implementation guide and the underlying FHIR are licensed as public domain, this guide includes examples making use of terminologies such 
    as LOINC, SNOMED CT and others which have more restrictive licensing requirements. Implementers should make themselves familiar with licensing and 
    any other constraints of terminologies, questionnaires, and other components used as part of their implementation process. In some cases, 
    licensing requirements may limit the systems that data captured using certain questionnaires may be shared with.
